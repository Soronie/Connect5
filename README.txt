The program initializes a 12 x 12 array of JButtons, each of which represents a unit on the game board.  The red and green mushrooms each indicates an individual player.
Every time a space becomes occupied, a separate terminal takes note of its coordinates on the grid.  The game stops whenever a five-in-a-row of a single color is detected.
